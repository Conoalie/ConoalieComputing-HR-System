# Conoalie Computing – Human Resources Information System (HRIS)

## Project Overview
This project is a static web-based Human Resources Information System (HRIS) developed as part of a university module. The system demonstrates how Business Information Systems can be used to present structured organisational information through a web browser.

The website is designed as an **internal HR system** for a fictional IT company, Conoalie Computing, and focuses on information structure, presentation, and usability using HTML and CSS.

## System Purpose
The HRIS provides employees, managers, and HR staff with access to:
- Human Resources policies and guidance
- Employee benefits information
- Training and professional development resources
- A simulated HR contact and data capture form

The system is informational only and does not process or store data.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 (semantic markup)
- CSS3 (external stylesheet, Flexbox layout, responsive design)
- Google Fonts
- GitHub Pages for deployment
